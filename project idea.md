The idea is an app for freshman university students to more optimally find/establish a friend group, find love, meet people they would've never reached out in person/thought they were compatible with, all ideally within the first semester/year of their time on campus

It targets young people at an extremely transitory period of their lives and one of the most fundamental human needs - finding/building meaningful connections,

The primary discovery method would involve a feed based profile with fully customizable photo stacks, personal information, as well as interactive q&a's built right into the profile. Photos are encouraged but completely optional. However, there will be minimum length/amount of text information on a profile.

The matching algorithm will hopefully bring closer freshmen in similar programs/faculties as well as people sharing a certain amount/more commonalities who are all entering their university life at the time of signup.

The idea behind is to always believe in the better side of people by not letting the lack of experience at making a good first impression stop them from building deeper connections

The use of a snapchat like map interface is to bridge the physicality of a geologically close knit campus life (quite self explanatory, campus life = life on/around campus) and the digital nature of phone apps

Matter of fact the whole app is designed to be like a train station/airport (a transitory place) except that you come here with few friends/alone but you leave this app with more people whom you know you have the potential to become friends with to a degree so it's up to you to go on to build deeper connections or find some more

No more crowded first year gatherings filled with people you know absolutely nothing about except how they look at that time of the day. No more ice breakers and other awkward first year events being forced down your throat by student organizations.

It is designed to be as organic as possible in such a way that the only difference meeting fellow freshmen irl vs on this app is the need for an ice breaking opener out of the blue and the possibility of being in completely different programs (eng vs arts), which can be done by a simple filter, it's totally possible people from completely different programs to become friends, it's totally up to you

At the very minimum it could be just used by freshmen for the first couple months of school from orientation week till the first xmas as a way to organize unofficial gatherings in a more organic, more efficient way, beyond just word of mouth from one friend to another friend, which in the end the last friend who heard this might not even know remotely that the first friend started it.

Traditional, irl freshmen meetups:
crowded, awkward "themed" gatherings being forced down by student organizations
you don't know most people there, most people there don't know you, except the fact that they can guess you are also freshman and potentially just a socially awkward creep, which you probably are, but you don't believe that deep down, do you? You just wanna meet new people
There is a possibility that even if you do break the ice with other fellow freshmen, they end up being in completely different programs with completely different courses, course loads, most importantly, your personalities/lifestyles just don't match. yall just dont fuck with each other. and that is okay. the app fixes that
People just generally don't like strangers. And that's natural. Nothing wrong with that. Every friend group starts with a couple of people

This app:
You control what you put on your profile. Full freedom to present yourself. We all know as guys we don't know how to take good pictures. Looks are of course important, it only becomes an issue if you run into some shallow people in real life judging you based on how you look. (assuming you are dressed reasonably and average built)
You control -- people in the same or similar faculties, similar programs, people whose vibe you fuck with, you get to chit chat a bit and wait until you have like a few people to meet up. One becomes two. two becomes three. three becomes five and so on.

1. Map Interface:

Think snapchat map, only shows you your existing friends, where you are staying (home address excluded), once they have 5-10 friends, if two or more friends are gathered at the same location, one of these friends can choose to post an update on the map that the friends who are not there can see and decide if they want to come or message the friends who are already there.

It is designed to let people find more opportunities to gather around physically, with the ones you already know that you are compatible with to a degree.

2. chat interface: 

By default before a user has more than five friends their DMs are open to everyone verified on the platform (verified with school emails).

After that they have the option to set a filter for at least x number of mutual friends

By default if you are not filtered out then the moment your message is delivered you become friended

Then either side has the option of leaving the conversation

leaving conversation = unfriended

Blocking is available as usual.

A recommendation feed of not yet friended users with the highest number of mutual friends is available with their profiles attached


3. feed interface

Before a user has sent any messages, the discovery feed is the only interface of the app available except for personal profile/settings page, unless someone sends them a message

A second look back into a profile previously viewed is not only allowed but encouraged
